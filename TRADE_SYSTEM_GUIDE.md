## 🛡️ Overcharging Protection

### Automatic Fairness Detection

The system calculates fairness based on **value difference percentage**:

```
Fairness Score = 100 - (|Value Difference| / Requested Price × 100)
```

### Fairness Levels

| Fairness Score | Status | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **70-100%** | ✅ Fair | Trade is balanced and fair |
| **50-69%** | ⚠️ Questionable | Moderate price difference |
| **0-49%** | ❌ Unfair | Large price difference |

### Warning Threshold: 30%

If the price difference exceeds **30%**, the trade is:
- 🚨 **Automatically flagged** for review
- ⚠️ **Warning shown** to user
- 🛡️ **Requires admin approval** before proceeding

**Example of Flagged Trade:**
- Requested: Laptop (Ksh 50,000)
- Offered: Phone (Ksh 20,000)
- Difference: -Ksh 30,000 (60% difference)
