# Gemini AI Price Checker Setup Guide

## Getting Your Gemini API Key

1. **Visit Google AI Studio**
   - Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create API Key**
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Select your Google Cloud project (or create a new one)
   - Copy the generated API key

3. **Configure the Price Checker**
   - Open `/js/price-checker.js`
   - Replace `'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'` on line 4 with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   this.apiKey = 'your-actual-api-key-here';
   ```

## Security Best Practices

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The current implementation stores the API key in the frontend code, which is suitable for development/testing only.

For production, consider:
- Store API key in environment variables
- Create a backend endpoint that proxies requests to Gemini
- Implement rate limiting and usage monitoring
